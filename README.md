# Youtube_webscraping_Project

**Project: YOUTUBER COMPARISONS**

- This project analyzes and compares the video metrics of popular YouTube Data Analysts and is the first in a series of data scraping projects on this repository

- This project requires you to formulate your own API key to pull requests by registering on Google Developer.  

- Once, this API key is generated, please insert in place of YOUR-GOOGLE-API-KEY-HERE in the source code.

- Sample code requests to call the YouTube API for each of the following: playlists, videos, channels etc can be found here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs

- All visualizations were simple bar graphs created with the Seaborn library and Pandas Dataframe
