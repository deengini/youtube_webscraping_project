This repository contains a collection of my web scraping projects

**Project: YOUTUBER ANALYST COMPARISON**
This project requires you to formulate your own API key to pull requests by registering on Google Developer.  

Once, this API key is generated, please insert in place of YOUR-GOOGLE-API-KEY-HERE

This project analyzes and compares the video metrics of popular YouTube Data Analysts 

Sample code requests to call the YouTube API for each of the following: playlists, videos, channels etc can be found here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs

All visualizations were simple bar graphs created with the Seaborn library and Pandas Dataframe
